If you were excited about Bitcoin's potential as a transactional currency, you'll be even more enthusiastic when you discover that its greatest feature is arguably a store of value. Here's why Bitcoin stands out as a superior asset for preserving wealth:
Scarcity: Just as gold, one of the rarest metals on Earth, cannot be easily increased in quantity due to the high costs and intense labor of mining, Bitcoin mirrors this limitation. With a cap of only 21 million coins, Bitcoin is the only liquid asset with a fixed maximum supply, making it the scarcest asset globally.
Constant and Predictable Supply Schedule: Unlike gold, whose annual production fluctuates between 1-3% of its existing supply and can increase with rising gold prices, Bitcoin's supply schedule is immutable. The protocol dictates a fixed, predictable introduction of new coins, ensuring no surprises in future supply.
Durability: Gold's enduring nature, resistant to corrosion and oxidation, is paralleled by Bitcoin's digital resilience. Bitcoin does not degrade over time, maintaining its utility indefinitely without physical wear and tear.
Verifiability: While verifying gold can be challenging and often requires specialized knowledge or equipment, Bitcoin simplifies this process. Each transaction and coin ownership can be verified through the blockchain transparently and securely, without the need for third-party verification.
Storability: Storing gold securely can be costly and requires physical space, whether personally or through a custodian. Bitcoin, on the other hand, can be stored on digital devices or even memorized as a seed phrase, providing effective storage without physical constraints or costs.
Portability: Gold's physical weight makes it cumbersome to transport, especially in large quantities. Bitcoin excels in portability; it can be accessed globally via the internet, carried on small devices like USB drives, or even remembered as a passphrase, facilitating easy and secure international transactions and transport.
Divisibility: The dense value of gold limits its divisibility, especially for micro-transactions. In contrast, Bitcoin can be divided up to eight decimal places, allowing for transactions as small as one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin (known as a Satoshi), making it extraordinarily versatile in transaction sizes.
Non-sovereign and Seizure Resistance: Gold's physical nature historically necessitated central storage, often in government-controlled vaults, leading to risks of government seizure and reliance on central authorities for transaction verification. Bitcoin is decentralized and operates independently of governmental control, significantly reducing the risk of seizure and enhancing privacy.
Each of these attributes contributes to why Bitcoin is not just a currency, but a revolutionary asset for securing long-term value."

To comprehend why Bitcoin might become a viable alternative, it's worth revisiting the reasons behind the downfall of the most significant empire before the 19th century.
At its peak, the Roman Empire encompassed 130 million people across nearly 4 million square kilometers. Trade played a crucial role in sustaining this massive civilization. The Romans engaged in the trade of essential commodities such as meat, grains, leather, marble, olive oil, silk, and spices.
The denarius, a silver coin with intrinsic value, served as the stable currency for this trade. Initially, each denarius contained approximately 4.5 grams of silver, equivalent to a day's wage for a skilled laborer.
Similar to other ancient civilizations, Rome pursued expansionist policies to safeguard against neighboring threats and amass wealth through conquests. This necessitated maintaining a large military force of generals and soldiers, all of whom were paid by the state.
In addition to military expenses, the empire incurred administrative, logistical, and social welfare costs. At its zenith, Rome constructed over 80,000 kilometers of roads and provided vital infrastructure such as aqueducts and bathhouses.
The extent of Rome's expenditure was directly tied to its capacity to mint coins and fund its operations. Coins were primarily sourced from the wealth acquired through conquests and taxes levied on the population.
However, at a certain point, Rome's spending surpassed its revenue, creating a situation that might sound familiar. In addition to escalating taxes on the populace, another approach was to debase the currency.
The first emperor to debase the denarius was Nero in 64 AD. Initially, the impact of debasement was minimal, but like a silent malady, if left unaddressed, it led to severe repercussions.
Subsequent emperors also resorted to debasement whenever Rome faced financial difficulties, using it to pay off debts, acquire resources, fund undertakings, and enrich political allies. Over time, this influx of coins drove inflation to unsustainable levels.
Rampant inflation eroded the wealth of ordinary Romans, while the ruling elite capitalized on the newly minted coins to acquire valuable assets before inflation took hold. This enabled the elite to gain early access to resources, leading to exponential growth in the monetary value of their assets and exacerbating wealth inequality, ultimately impoverishing the masses.
Debasement became more pronounced around 200 AD, as none of the ruling emperors were able to reduce expenses to align with revenues, opting instead to further dilute the coins.
By 265 AD, with only 0.5% silver remaining in a denarius, prices across the Roman Empire surged by 1,000%. Hyperinflation, exorbitant taxes, and devalued currency severely disrupted Rome's trade, leading to economic stagnation.
By the end of the 3rd century, remaining trade largely relied on inefficient bartering methods, as constant civil conflicts left the empire's borders vulnerable. Trade networks disintegrated, with such activities becoming increasingly perilous.
The Roman Empire fell victim to invasions from various barbarian forces, ultimately leading to its demise. Alaric I, the chief of the Visigoths, led the army that sacked Rome in August 410 AD. Finally, in 476 AD, Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain, deposed the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, marking the end of the Western Roman Empire.

Reflecting on Rome's example in the present day, let's examine a hypothetical company:
Imagine a company with an annual revenue of $4.1 million, but its expenses during the same period amount to $5.6 million. As a result, by the end of the year, the company not only failed to make a profit but also incurred a $1.5 million lossâ€”equivalent to 37% of its revenue.
Now, consider that this loss is not an isolated incident. This company has been unprofitable since 2001 and has been accumulating losses year after year. As of today, its total debt has climbed to $35.3 million.
Have you ever wondered how a company can keep paying its bills without making a profit? Well, the secret lies in the fact that the company keeps going into debt year after year by borrowing money from investors. These investors trust that the company will eventually be able to pay back its debts, and the company promises to repay the borrowed amount along with interest.
The issue is that since the company is unable to generate profits, it has to keep issuing more and more debt securities each year. These securities are used not only to cover the company's expenses but also to repay investors and cover the interest.
Consider this: as the company's time without making a profit extends, it raises doubts in the minds of investors, making them uncertain about its ability to repay its debts. Consequently, they demand higher interest rates, making it more expensive for the company to borrow money.
For instance, last year, the company had to pay $1.1 million in interest alone, which accounted for almost a third of its total revenue. It's evident that the company is in a difficult financial situation, and getting out of it won't be simple.
To add to the challenge, the company's owners keep appointing advisors and presidents who, instead of reducing costs, continue to expand them. It seems that nobody, not even the owners, is genuinely worried about the organization's future.
The situation is further complicated by the company's heavy reliance on a bank that always promises financial support. This creates a risky scenario: a bank that provides unlimited credit, and owners who appear indifferent to the company's reckless path.
Now, here's the big reveal: this "company" isn't a company; it's the United States government. The "bank" is the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank. The true owners should be the American people. The figures we've used here are actually in trillions, not millions. To illustrate how challenging it is for us to grasp such different magnitudes, here's a comparison to make it easier to understand:
1 million seconds ago: Less than 12 days ago (our example);
1 billion seconds ago: October 1992;
1 trillion seconds ago: 29,665 BC (US Government)
If you were impressed by the fictional company's numbers, consider the real impact once you understand the difference between millions and trillions. This analogy helps to illustrate the severity of the U.S. fiscal situation, revealing that managing debt and interest is becoming increasingly challenging.
In the face of this difficult scenario, what can be done? Increasing revenue (i.e., raising taxes) to cover the deficit seems unfeasible. Aside from directly impacting the entire population's wallets, it discourages entrepreneurship, job creation, and income generation. On the other hand, cutting spending to the extent of removing long-standing benefits from the population would be politically unsustainable. The only solution seems to be to continue incurring debt to pay the bills.
But how long can the Federal Reserve sustain this cycle? That's the million, billion, or even trillion-dollar question. One thing is for certain: in historical events where people lose confidence in their currency, they rush toward assets that cannot be devalued.

The fall of the Roman Empire serves as a historical warning about the dangers of debasing currency. The Romans diluted their silver Denarius, leading to its rejection. Similarly, modern central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, are printing large amounts of money to fund government spending, raising fears of devaluation and a flight from the US dollar.
Originally a reliable store of value, the Denarius was gradually debased with less silver, leading to inflation as its purchasing power diminished. This loss of trust in the currency led to people hoarding coins and resorting to barter, crippling Roman trade and contributing to economic problems.
Today's fiat currencies, not backed by physical assets like gold, rely on public trust for stability. Excessive money printing by central banks can erode this trust and lead to inflation. As a result, people and countries may hoard cash, demand higher interest rates, seek alternative stores of value such as gold, diversify currency holdings, or seek alternatives like Bitcoin and decentralized systems.
Bitcoin offers a unique alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority, and its supply is limited, making it attractive to some investors seeking a hedge against potential currency devaluation.
The future of fiat currencies depends on balancing adequate liquidity for economic growth with maintaining confidence in their value. Only time will tell if we have learned from history's mistakes and whether digital assets like Bitcoin can provide a new haven.
