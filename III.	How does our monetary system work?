Since the first deals made between us humans, something has always been present: trust.
In ancient times, when one tribe started trading with another, they would exchange goods. For example, one tribe might have apples while the other had animals. If both parties agreed, they would make the trade. Trust was essential, as individuals from each tribe would personally deliver the goods.
Our transition from direct barter to the use of money as a medium of exchange marked a significant change in trade. In this case, money could be anything from shells, cows, and even gold—something that both parties involved in the trade considered valuable enough to be used again in future trades.
In ancient Mesopotamia, the Code of Hammurabi introduced a new concept of trade. It marked the emergence of a trusted third party to facilitate trade. Instead of carrying gold everywhere, people could deposit it with an institution and receive a paper note in return. This note represented a promise that the gold could be retrieved at any time.

For the first time in history, you no longer needed to carry around your valuables or meet your trading partner in person to ensure everything was secure. Instead, there was a trusted third party holding your gold and providing a written guarantee on your behalf.
The concept of paper money, representing a significant evolution in the idea of a third-party trust holding value and issuing guarantees, first appeared in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD). It became more common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD), which officially issued the world's first paper money known as "jiaozi" around the 11th century due to a shortage of copper for coinage. This innovation allowed the government to print paper money, which was easier to carry in large amounts and facilitated economic transactions.
In the 13th century, the concept of paper money and the involvement of banks in issuing such guarantees spread to Europe. This was influenced by travelers like Marco Polo, who described the use of paper money in the Yuan Dynasty under Kublai Khan.
European countries started using promissory notes which later transformed into paper money. In the 17th century, the Bank of England was among the first European institutions to issue banknotes. Initially, these notes represented a promise to exchange the paper for its value in gold or silver. However, by 1833, the Bank Charter Act in England established banknotes as legal tender. This was a significant development in the formalization of third-party institutions (central banks) holding value and providing guarantees in the form of paper money.

During this critical time, we witnessed the establishment of a centralized structure under the supervision of the central authorities. This marked the start of a new era in our financial system, bringing us closer to a well-organized and regulated economic environment.

The Fascinating Story of Yap Island's Rai Stones
If you were to arrive on the island of Yap with your pockets full of gold or silver coins, you would likely find it difficult to purchase anything.
This is because, until the 19th century, the island's inhabitants used a peculiar payment system: large, heavy, circular stones carved from limestone that were obtained from the quarries on the island of Palau.
Despite their large size, these stones are too heavy for the islanders to use in transactions.
And how were transactions conducted at that time?
The island's inhabitants collectively knew who owned which stone and had mentally retained records of past transactions.
A young worker expressed his desire to buy the fisherman's boat and to make this official, he declared to all the island's inhabitants that his stone, situated on the shore, would be transferred to and owned by the fisherman. This news quickly spread throughout the community.
In the future, if the fisherman wished to pass this stone to someone else, the inhabitants would be able to permit it, as most, if not all of them, knew that the stone belonged to him. In essence, any resident could use a stone to make a purchase as long as the majority of the community agreed that he was the current owner of the stone. Therefore, there was no way to steal the stones, since their possession was known to everyone on the island.
The value of each stone was determined not just by its size and weight, but also by its history. If many people had died while it was being transported to the island, then it was considered rarer and more valuable. In other words, the more stories surrounded the stone, the greater its value.
The interesting part of this system is that economic activity on the island occurred without any stones needing to be physically moved. A person could own a stone on the other side of the island and not have to worry about someone stealing it.
The financial system using Rai Stones worked so well that even if a stone was lost, for example, falling to the bottom of the sea during transport, everyone agreed that it should still exist and it continued to be used in transactions.
According to local legend, about 500 years ago, the people of Yap discovered limestone quarries in Palau when a Yapese sailor named Anagumang led an expedition there. He noticed that these stones did not exist on his island, making them precious. Initially, Anagumang ordered the first blocks to be cut into the shape of a fish, but soon after, they began collecting stones in the shape of a wheel to make them easier to transport. Workers used to put a log inside the hole in the middle to make transportation easier.
The Yapese people didn't acquire Rai's stones without cost. Negotiations were required with the people of Palau, who requested large amounts of beads and coconut pulp.
The distributed consensus system offers advantages over a centralized system. For example, if a single person on the island of Yap held the official record of stone ownership, they could abuse their power by demanding transaction fees, altering records to steal stones, or losing the records, causing chaos.
Rai's stone system is both intangible (as there's no need to physically transport stones around the island) and decentralized (as there's no need to rely on an intermediary).
The key point is that intangible monetary systems rely on trust. We only relinquish control if we trust an organization or individual to maintain accurate records. In the case of the island of Yap, trust was placed in the decentralized system (the collective memory of all island inhabitants) rather than in an intermediary.
This system functioned effectively until 1871 when navigator David O'Keefe was shipwrecked near the island and was rescued by locals. After the incident, O'Keefe realized that he could make a profit by buying coconuts from the island and selling them to coconut oil producers on the mainland. However, the locals were not enticed by anything he offered because they already had a good life and saw no use for the forms of money he presented.
Since only stones from Rai would suffice, O'Keefe went to Hong Kong, purchased a large boat and explosives, extracted several stones from Palau, and brought them to Yap to exchange for coconuts. To his surprise, the locals were unwilling to accept the stones because, in their view, the stones were acquired without effort. They believed that only stones extracted with effort, blood, and sweat would hold value. However, some Yapese recognized an opportunity and accepted the stones in exchange for coconuts.
"The consequence is that this generated a conflict on the island and, from then on, the entire distributed registry system began to collapse. Today, the island uses the dollar as its official currency. However, Rai stones continue to be used in social ceremonies such as weddings, agreements, and business as a way of sealing alliances. If you found the story of Yap's Rai Stones and their unique, decentralized way of tracking value interesting, you'll likely find the concept of Bitcoin fascinating. Bitcoin takes this idea into the digital realm, using blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and decentralized financial system".
