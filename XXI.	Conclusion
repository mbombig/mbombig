After years of reading, studying, and numerous discussions, I realized that Bitcoin is more than just a technological breakthrough or a new financial asset. It is a tool that can help us regain our freedom. Initially, my focus was on understanding the underlying technology of Bitcoin, specifically the blockchain, and its potential to address real-world problems. However, as my understanding deepened, I began to see that the true power of Bitcoin lies in its ability to escape the control of centralized institutions and return control to individuals.
This journey has been one of discovery, not just of Bitcoin's technical aspects, but also of the very essence of what it means to be free in a world where control is often held by incumbent entities and organizations. Governments, banks, or corporations cannot control Bitcoin. Instead, it allows us to make transactions without needing to trust intermediaries and to preserve value without the fear of inflation eating away at it, or authorities seizing it. In a world where control over money often equates to control over people, Bitcoin stands as our tool for freedom. It's money in its purest form, untouched by the agendas of those who seek to exert power over it.
As I explored deeper into the world of Bitcoin, I started to see it not just as a financial tool but as a lens through which I could view other aspects of life, like education, health, morality, and our values. It wasn't until I truly understood how our fiat financial system operates that my worldview shifted, allowing me to grasp the interests and subsequent actions taken by various institutions, organizations, and governments. Just as Bitcoin strips away layers of control and influence from money, it encourages us to question the institutions that shape our lives and seek out the purest form of these concepts.
The untouched bitcoins left by Satoshi Nakamoto symbolize this freedom. They are not just proof of the brilliance behind Bitcoin but also reinforce the idea that true wealth doesn't lie in material possessions but in our ability to live freely, according to our values and principles.
These coins, visible yet inaccessible to all, remind us that real wealth isn't about the quantity of assets but about the freedom to use them as we wish.
This book reflects my journey towards understanding freedom. It's not a technical manual or an economic study as there are others far more qualified to write those. Instead, it's an attempt to share the insights and curiosities that have shaped my understanding of Bitcoin and, by extension, my knowledge of what it means to be truly free."
The greatest gift that Bitcoin offers us is not just a new financial asset, but also the freedom to question, challenge, and live according to our values. This is the true legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto - a legacy of freedom that invites us to embark on a journey of discovery and find the purest, freest version of ourselves.
