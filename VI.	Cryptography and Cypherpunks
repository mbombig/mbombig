During World War II, England and its allies successfully decoded the Enigma code, which was a significant turning point in the war. Up until then, communication privacy relied on secret codes that could be discovered by governments and spies. This process, known as symmetric cryptography, requires both the sender and receiver to have the secret code.
In 1977, researchers at MIT developed a highly secure encryption method for messages that were considered unbreakable by interceptors. This drew the attention of authorities, and the NSA (National Security Agency) threatened to arrest the authors if they published their work. The U.S. government classified this mechanism as wartime technology and prohibited its distribution under international arms trafficking regulations, leading MIT to shelve plans to publish the study.
A 20-year-old Yale University student, Mark Miller, read about the mechanism in a science magazine and visited MIT to obtain a copy of the study. After acquiring it, he made several copies and distributed them to computing enthusiasts, organizations, magazines, and friends, urging them to widely disseminate the study in case he mysteriously disappeared.
In early 1978, the U.S. Federal Government allowed the publication of a study that introduced technology enabling secure, private communication free from institutional control or censorship. This marked the beginning of asymmetric (public and private key) cryptography, which granted the world access to revolutionary technology.
Public key cryptography provided two essential functions: it verified the sender's identity and allowed anyone to read the message. It also enabled anyone to send a message to a specific person, but only the intended recipient had the secret key to read it, much like a mailbox that anyone can drop a letter into, but only the mail carrier has the key to open it and access the messages.
This advancement made it nearly impossible for government and spy agencies to monitor and intercept messages since they couldn't decipher them. This technology provided a level of privacy that was previously unattainable.
Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence agencies aimed to keep this technology from the public, treating encryption as a matter of national security. However, they didn't anticipate the power of academic freedom and software development, as they attempted to criminalize the use of public key cryptography.
In the early 1990s, a group of mathematicians, hackers, and hobbyists recognized the Internet's potential to enable a decentralized form of human freedom, while also acknowledging the possibility of it leading to a surveillance state similar to the one portrayed in George Orwell's 1984. Their goal was to prevent the government from having the authority to dictate reality, akin to appointing a so-called "minister of truth."
The government saw cryptography as a threat to its control and surveillance in the digital world, leading to the emergence of cypherpunks who saw cryptography as a choice between freedom and state control. Tim May, a key figure in the cypherpunk movement and a scientist at Intel, envisioned the internet as a place where individuals could operate without censorship or government control. Inspired by Friedrich Hayek, another group known as Hi-tech Hayekians saw the potential of computers to change society by decentralizing commerce and spreading knowledge.
Phil Salin, an economist and entrepreneur, was a key figure in this movement, creating AMIX (American Information Exchange), a platform for trading information online. In 1987, after meeting Tim May, Salin saw AMIX as a tool for evading government control. By 1988, AMIX was acquired by Autodesk, and the ideas of Hi-tech Hayekians began to merge with those of cryptographers, giving birth to the cypherpunk movement. Despite Phil Salin's death in 1991, his discussions with Tim May laid the foundation for the cypherpunks' ultimate challenge: creating a decentralized, self-custodial digital currency.
Concerns about computers integrating into daily life and potentially leading to increased surveillance prompted cryptography to be seen as a means of ensuring public privacy. The battle for the freedom to create and distribute encryption software had begun.
In 1991, software developer Phil Zimmermann released PGP, a secure messaging protocol using public key technology, which became especially popular in authoritarian regimes. The U.S. Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation against Zimmermann, lasting three years, alleging he violated international arms control laws by allowing access to his software outside the U.S. Meanwhile, the NSA claimed Zimmermann's software could be used by terrorists and criminals. Despite these claims, the cypherpunks argued that PGP, like any software, was simply a series of machine instructions.
In the early '90s, John Gilmore, a cypherpunk co-founder, campaigned for recognition that regulating cryptography violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees free speech rights. Supporters explored various ideas to circumvent government restrictions, aiming to demonstrate that encryption software was akin to any other form of expression. One notable initiative was led by Phil Zimmermann, who persuaded MIT to adopt a unique approach: print the PGP code in a book format and export it to European bookstores. This strategy hinged on the belief that if the U.S. government tried to ban the publication of a book by a university, it would likely face significant legal challenges. Meanwhile, some enthusiasts took to tattooing software codes containing encryption snippets on their bodies, questioning whether authorities would prevent them from traveling abroad.
Authorities never fully pursued the classification of encryption as a wartime weapon, nor did they implement the proposed penalties. In 1996, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it would not continue criminal charges against Zimmermann. Additionally, two Supreme Court judges affirmed that encryption codes were indeed protected under the First Amendment.
This period marked significant victories in the right to create and distribute encryption software. The challenge then shifted to developing tools that could be widely used by the public. Four years prior, in 1992, cypherpunks had created an email list to exchange information among movement enthusiasts. Their goal was to utilize cryptography to enable secure, private, and uncensorable communication and transactions worldwide. There was a consensus that a network of interconnected individuals, without a centralized authority, was the key to achieving the movement's objectives. However, until then, efforts had only led to networks reliant on a central entity to enforce rules. A truly distributed, ownerless system had yet to be created and functionally used.
Replicating one particular government function, currency issuance, using cryptography to eliminate the central entity was especially challenging. Here begins the cypherpunks' quest to build an internet-based monetary system without barriers, as anonymous as cash, and, like gold, able to maintain its value without central bank coercion. A decentralized monetary system would be crucial for individuals to have control and coercion-resistant activities and assets. Perhaps the greatest hurdle was developing a digital asset that couldn't be duplicated.
