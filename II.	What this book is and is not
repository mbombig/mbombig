I am not a computer engineer or developer, and I don't know how to write code. I even failed the only programming class I took in college, which happened to be in the C++ language (the programming language in which Bitcoin was written). So don't expect this book to be deep and complete in technical terms.
I'm not an economist, even though I passed the only economics class I took in college. Therefore, don't expect detailed explanations about our monetary and fiscal system, or how the economy works.
I want to make it clear that I am not a professional writer. As a result, this book may lack the polished prose found in the work of experienced authors. My goal is to share insights and curiosities as clearly and engagingly as possible, even though my writing style may not match that of seasoned writers.
Before publishing it, I shared the manuscript with individuals who possess much greater technical knowledge than mine, both in terms of programming and economics. I received valuable feedback, criticism, and suggestions for improvements. Despite this, the book may contain errors and concepts that might be incorrect, outdated, or subject to correction or improvement.
However, I learned one thing with Bitcoin: The more interested and dedicated you are to studying and researching it, the more questions and curiosity you will have!
After dedicating all this time, I managed to have a better understanding of the problems that exist in our global financial system, and the characteristics that make Bitcoin an alternative.
This book is a humble attempt to explain how Bitcoin works, breaking down its concepts in an order that has enriched my understanding. Starting with one concept, I built the confidence to explore the next, creating a domino effect of learning.
I hope that by the end, you'll grasp the workings of Bitcoin as thoroughly as I have.
It's important to note what this book will not cover.
We won't dive into Bitcoin's monetary philosophy, topics well-explored by Saifedean Ammous in The Bitcoin Standard and Lyn Alden in Broken Money, for example.
Similarly, this isn't a deep dive into the technical workings, a niche thoroughly covered by Andreas Antonopoulos' Mastering Bitcoin and Kalle Rosenbaum's Grokking Bitcoin, both of which served as invaluable resources.
Nor will this book discuss investment strategies, or legal, financial, or tax advice related to Bitcoin. Questions like "What's the best Bitcoin wallet?", "When's the best time to buy Bitcoin?", or "How do I declare my Bitcoins?" are outside its scope. Thus, nothing in this book should be taken as financial, tax, or legal advice.
This book is my way of giving back for all the knowledge I've gained in recent years. Just as I am thankful for everyone who took the time to write, produce videos, organize events, or even chat with me and answer my questions, I aim to offer my contribution to the next wave of curious and enthusiastic individuals seeking to understand Bitcoin.
I am dedicated to ensuring that this book can be distributed and read completely free of charge. The Gutenberg press revolutionized the dissemination of knowledge, opening it up to a wider audience by making it physically accessible worldwide. The internet further facilitated access to digital knowledge, allowing it to be distributed without barriers and at minimal cost. I am happy to share that the contents of this book can be freely copied and distributed, ensuring that anyone in the world can access it.
While physical copies and versions for digital reading devices will also be available, they do come with production costs that must be covered. I have chosen to forgo any copyright remuneration to ensure that the content of this book remains freely available.
This book serves as a diary of notes about new learning. What I wrote years ago may be out-of-date by the time I published it, and many other concepts may also be out-of-date by the time you read it. More importantly, I hope that you will consider yourself not just as a reader but as a collaborator. You may submit any concerns or problems to me at any time.
I'll make sure to remember the text you provided.
I'm open to feedback and willing to learn from any mistakes. This material isn't copyrighted, so feel free to modify it or create your version. As most of my sources are in English, I started writing about Bitcoin concepts in English and continued with this language for the book. This presented a challenge, as English is not my native language, and the Portuguese version had to be translated from English. However, this decision allowed me to achieve something valuable: publishing the book simultaneously in Portuguese and English, making it accessible to a wider audience.
