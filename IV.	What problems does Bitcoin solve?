The financial system is essential to our economy as it enables transactions, savings, trading, investments, and the flow of money between individuals, businesses, and governments. Nowadays, most financial systems are centralized and overseen by central authorities, such as central banks, financial regulatory bodies, and major financial institutions.
However, its centralized nature also introduces several vulnerabilities, as we will see below.

Centralization and Control
The modern financial system is centered around two main entities: governments and central banks. These authorities have significant control over the economy through their regulation of monetary policy, including decisions on issuing money and setting interest rates.
Central banks, as the financial backbone of their governments, have the power to issue currency, often used to cover government expenses when revenues fall short. However, excessive issuance of money without corresponding economic growth can lead to inflation.
Inflation erodes the purchasing power and savings of the population and can cause economic instability. This rise in the general price level of goods and services diminishes the value of money, leading to increased living costs for the population, especially impacting those with fixed incomes. Inflationary policies can have widespread effects, creating uncertainty and discouraging long-term investments, affecting both individual financial health and broader economic stability.
When the Federal Reserve (the Fed) decides to print more money, its aim might be to boost the economy, bail out financial institutions, or fund particular businesses. However, this injection of cash doesn't immediately reach everyone equally.
Here's how it typically flows: The Fed creates new money and uses it to purchase troubled assets, like bad loans, from banks. This exchange helps the banks because they don't have to wait for these loans to be paid back. With fresh capital now available, banks are more inclined to lend again.
Generally, the first people able to access this new money are the wealthier, well-connected individuals and companies. They can borrow more easily and use this capital to make investments at a time when prices are still relatively low.
However, as this new money begins to circulate more broadly, it dilutes the overall purchasing power. By the time it reaches everyday people, prices have usually increased because the amount of money in the economy has risen without a corresponding increase in goods and services. This scenario is known as the Cantillon effect, which exacerbates economic inequality: those who get the money first can profit from it, while those who get it later face higher prices without the benefit of having spent the money when it was worth more.
Ultimately, if you own scarce assets, their nominal value tends to increase, making you feel wealthier and more secure. But this feeling of security contrasts sharply with those at the bottom of the economic ladder, who experience their purchasing power diminishing more rapidly due to rising prices and the late arrival of new money in their hands.

A relevant example of the risks associated with centralization and control in monetary policy is the recent actions of the Federal Reserve (the FED), the central banking system of the United States. In response to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the FED implemented an unprecedented monetary expansion program. This program involved cutting interest rates to near zero and purchasing large quantities of government securities, effectively leading to the printing of money to support government spending and stimulate the economy.
While this strategy was intended to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic, it had significant side effects. One of the most notable effects was an acceleration in US inflation rates. In the years following the FED's aggressive monetary expansion, the United States experienced a sharp rise in inflation, reaching levels not seen in decades. This surge in inflation highlighted the delicate balance central banks must maintain and emphasized the potential consequences of expansive monetary policies.

Coercion
The term "coercion" in centralized financial systems refers to the undue influence or pressure exerted by powerful entities such as governments, regulatory bodies, or external organizations. These entities aim to manipulate financial and economic policies to their advantage, leveraging the concentrated decision-making within these systems. The concentration of power in centralized financial systems is vulnerable to manipulation, enabling these entities to enforce policies or actions that are not aligned with broader public interests or economic stability.
In centralized financial systems, critical decisions—from monetary policy to fiscal spending—are susceptible to political pressures or the interests of a few, rather than being determined by market forces or democratic processes. This susceptibility can lead to scenarios where external pressures and coercive measures result in long-lasting negative impacts on a nation's economy and its citizens.
In 2013, Cyprus faced a severe financial crisis due to high levels of debt, a struggling banking sector, and a weak economy. The country was on the brink of bankruptcy and needed a bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. However, the terms of the bailout came with a heavy price for the people of Cyprus. The EU and the IMF demanded that Cyprus implement a "bail-in" plan, which involved seizing a portion of the deposits from the country's two largest banks, Bank of Cyprus and Laiki Bank.
The plan involved confiscating up to 60% of uninsured deposits (over 100,000 euros) in Laiki Bank and converting a significant portion of Bank of Cyprus's uninsured deposits into equity. This meant that many depositors, including small businesses and individual investors, lost a significant portion of their savings overnight.
The bail-in plan was a form of coercion by the EU and the IMF. They used the threat of bankruptcy and financial collapse to force Cyprus to implement measures that would otherwise be unacceptable to its citizens. The plan was widely criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, as well as its disproportionate impact on small depositors and investors.
The Cyprus bail-in plan is a clear example of coercion in centralized finance. It shows how a centralized financial system, controlled by powerful institutions and governments, can use its power to impose measures that are detrimental to the interests of individual citizens and businesses.

Corruption
The existence of centralized financial systems can result in corruption, as individuals or groups within these authorities might bend policies for personal gain or to favor specific political or economic interests over the public good. Corruption can manifest in various ways, including bribery, embezzlement, and nepotism. In a centralized financial system, corruption can significantly impact the economy, the financial sector, and the well-being of citizens.
For instance, officials in central banks may exploit their authority to manipulate interest rates, money supply, and inflation for personal benefit or that of their associates. They may partake in insider trading, utilizing privileged information to make lucrative investments or influence the market. Additionally, they may leverage their positions to offer preferential treatment, such as loans or contracts, to friends, family, or political allies.
Corruption can also extend to the institutional level, with entire agencies or departments falling under the influence of special interests. This can lead to the implementation of policies that prioritize certain industries, companies, or groups at the expense of the public interest. A prominent historical example of this is the savings and loan crisis in the United States during the 1980s, which resulted from a combination of deregulation, risky lending practices, and corruption.
During the 1970s and 1980s, the US government deregulated the savings and loan industry, allowing these institutions to engage in riskier investments and expand their operations. This led to a surge in lending, particularly in the real estate market.
However, many savings and loan institutions took advantage of the deregulation to engage in fraudulent and corrupt practices. Executives and managers embezzled funds, engaged in insider trading, and granted loans to themselves and their associates without proper collateral or due diligence.
The corruption and risky lending practices led to a wave of defaults and bankruptcies, causing the savings and loan industry to collapse. The crisis cost taxpayers an estimated $124 billion, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

Data Leaks and Privacy Breaches
Centralized financial institutions store large amounts of personal and financial data, making them attractive targets for hackers. Data leaks and privacy breaches are not uncommon, compromising the financial security and privacy of millions.
Centralized financial systems rely on a central database or server to store and manage customer data, including names, addresses, social security numbers, account balances, and transaction histories. This centralization of data makes it easier for hackers to access and exploit sensitive information.
Data leaks and privacy breaches can occur through various means, including hacking and cyber-attacks, insider threats, and physical theft. Hackers can use various techniques, such as phishing, malware, and social engineering, to gain unauthorized access to a central database or server. Employees or contractors with access to the central database or server can intentionally or unintentionally leak sensitive information. Thieves can steal physical devices, such as laptops, hard drives, or paper records, containing sensitive information.
Data leaks and privacy breaches can have serious consequences for individuals and businesses, including financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liability. Hackers can use stolen financial information to commit fraud, identity theft, or other financial crimes. Financial institutions may face legal action and regulatory fines for failing to protect customer data.
A real-world example of a data leak in a centralized financial system is the 2017 Equifax data breach. Equifax is one of the three largest credit reporting agencies in the US, and the breach exposed the personal information of 147 million people, including names, social security numbers, birth dates, and addresses.
The breach occurred due to a vulnerability in Apache Struts, a popular open-source software framework used by Equifax. Hackers exploited the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to Equifax's central database and steal sensitive information.
The Equifax data breach is one of the largest and most damaging data leaks in history, and it highlights the risks of centralized financial systems. The breach exposed the personal information of millions of people, causing financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liability for Equifax.

In January 2024, a massive data leak, known as the "Mother of all breaches," was discovered. This breach resulted in the exposure of 26 billion records, making it the largest data leak in history so far.
The breach occurred due to a vulnerability in an unnamed database that was connected to the internet without proper security measures. Hackers exploited this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the database and steal sensitive information.
The stolen data included personal and financial information such as names, addresses, social security numbers, account balances, and transaction histories. This breach affected individuals and businesses in the US, Europe, and Asia.
The "Mother of all breaches" underscores the risks associated with centralized financial systems and highlights the critical importance of data security. This breach not only exposed the personal information of millions of people, but it also had the potential to cause financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liability for the victims.

Theft and Fraud
The centralized nature of fiat currencies makes them susceptible to theft and fraud, both digitally and physically. Physical security measures and digital safeguards can fail, leading to significant financial losses. Theft and fraud can occur through various means, such as physical theft, digital theft, and fraud. Physical theft can include muggings, burglaries, skimming, and theft during transportation or storage. Digital theft can include phishing, malware, and social engineering. Fraud can include identity theft, account takeover, and payment card fraud. Theft and fraud can have serious consequences for individuals and businesses, including financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liability. Financial institutions have a responsibility to protect their customers from theft and fraud, but the centralized nature of fiat currencies makes this a challenging task. A real-world example of theft and fraud in a centralized financial system is the 2016 Bangladesh Bank heist. The heist occurred when hackers attempted to steal nearly $1 billion from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The hackers gained unauthorized access to the Bangladesh central bank's systems and transferred $81 million to accounts in the Philippines and Sri Lanka. The heist was only discovered when officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York noticed suspicious activity and halted the transfers.

As we've delved into the flaws of the centralized financial system, we've come across various issues like centralization, control, coercion, corruption, data leaks, privacy breaches, theft, and fraud. These issues not only harm the integrity and efficiency of financial transactions but also expose individuals and institutions to significant risks. These problems illustrate the weakness of a system where power and control are concentrated, leading to a lack of transparency, unfair practices, and potential losses for the average citizen.
Such vulnerabilities are inevitable in systems with central points of failure, whether they be a company, an organization, or a government. These vulnerabilities existed even before the internet. In the past, if you needed to transmit a message, you had to rely on one of the few television or newspaper broadcasters. Entrusting critical infrastructures to just a few organizations is risky.
The internet eliminated central points of failure in the communications infrastructure and ushered in a wave of competition among new communication companies like portals and social networks. Blockchain technology empowered Bitcoin to disintermediate payments. Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency and operates thanks to blockchain technology. It allows you to send and receive values to and from anyone in the world using just a computer or mobile phone and an internet connection.
Bitcoin is groundbreaking because, unlike all other methods of sending money over the Internet, it works without the need to trust a centralized entity. The fact that it does not depend on a corporation as a trusted entity makes Bitcoin the world's first public digital payment infrastructure. Its public nature means that it is available to everyone and not owned by any single entity.
The emergence of the internet paved the way for a public infrastructure for information (websites) and communication (email, social networks). Before Bitcoin, the only public payment method available was cash, which only worked for face-to-face transactions. Before Bitcoin, making a remote payment (over the phone or through the internet) required trusting a private institution to update their accounting records, including a debit for you and a credit for the recipient.
In Bitcoin, the accounting records are publicly available and recorded on the blockchain, and anyone can include a transaction on the blockchain to transfer their bitcoins to anyone in the world. Additionally, anyone, regardless of nationality, religion, belief, or credibility, can create a Bitcoin address at no cost to receive digital payments. Its greatest quality is that it operates without the need for trusted intermediaries. Just like the internet, Bitcoin is a revolution that will be incredibly significant for our freedom, prosperity, and development.
