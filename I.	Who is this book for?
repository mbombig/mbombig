I.	Who is this book for?
In 2017, I did something I'm not very proud of: I fell in love with blockchain as a technology.!
The first time I heard about Bitcoin was in 2013 when I was still attending investment and finance forums. But at the time I didn't even care, after all, it seemed like something very crazy and far away from my reality. I barely had an international credit card, let alone buying a digital asset.
In 2016, I rekindled my interest in Bitcoin. By then, I was more mature and curious about technology, so I delved deeper into studying Bitcoin. However, instead of focusing on the problems that Bitcoin solved, I became more interested in understanding how the technology worked, leading me to pay more attention to Blockchain technology than Bitcoin itself.
At that moment, I distanced myself from Bitcoin and started dedicating myself to studying and better understanding how blockchain technology could be used in business models to solve real-world problems.
I have been involved in DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) projects and have met and stayed in touch with their founders. I have even participated in projects to implement real DLT use cases in decentralized autonomous device systems, also known as Machine to Machine Economy (M2M).
I have delved into the realm of DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs, and DAOs. I have researched and interacted with individuals in the industry, and have taken part in conversations, communities, and public speaking opportunities at various events.
It wasn't until 2019 that I began studying our current financial system, its benefits and flaws, which rekindled my interest in Bitcoin and its technology.
Since then, I have dedicated myself to better understanding Bitcoin in two aspects:
•	The first aspect involves understanding the monetary system (fiat) used worldwide today, how central banks and nation-states operate and finance their expenses, how they make changes and decisions regarding monetary policies, and ultimately, how Bitcoin can serve as an alternative to this model.
•	The technical aspect involves decades of study, work, and dedication that began with the cypherpunks' challenge to create a technology enabling humanity to have a digital asset. This would allow people to send and receive values to and from anyone in the world using a device connected to the internet, without needing to trust a middleman. This technology is the first public, digital payments infrastructure.
Throughout my journey, I began documenting technical concepts as I grasped them. This helped me solidify my understanding and create a repository of personally curated content for future reference.
After writing dozens of pages, I realized that consolidating all this content to share with others interested in understanding how Bitcoin works would make sense.
Exemplifying and using analogies have helped me greatly in consolidating concepts. Therefore, I include examples and analogies when explaining concepts to facilitate understanding.
To avoid sounding like a mere collection of technical terms, I decided to include a brief introduction before diving into the technical concepts.
A short journey from the beginning of the quest for solutions to age-old problems.
